<h1>That is how I know you</h1>

<p>I remember looking at the sky a yesternight ago and the moon capturing my awe like it has always done. The sparkly Venus also caught up to my gaze (I say it like a mortal), not twinkling. Does it also sometimes desire to twinkle and be like the stars? I wonder out of my mortality.</p>

<p>Easy right? How about combining a Venus with it's twin. What did you get? My goal here to get you to start thinking a little abstract, a little just yet. What is addition? Is the act of combining <code>"things"</code> into <code>"one"</code> addition? Yes, vaguely but yes it can be thought of like that. Let's label the <code>"things"</code> as <code>Elements</code> and call the <code>"one"</code> a <code>Set</code>. I hope I am doing some justice to <em>Set Theory</em> introduction.</p>

<p>So from our definition: Combining two Venus' gives us a... a big Venus (oolala dirty phonetics). Let's define <em>v<sub>e</sub></em> as an abstract element representing Venus, specifically the planet's essence. In Set Theory, a set is a collection of non-repeating elements. So combining <em>v<sub>e</sub></em> and <em>v<sub>e</sub></em> means forming the set <em>V = {v<sub>e</sub>, v<sub>e</sub>}</em>, which simplifies to <em>V = {v<sub>e</sub>}</em> because duplicates aren't counted.</p>

<p>This isn't numerical addition (like 2+2=4); it's collecting elements into a Set. If we think of each Venus as a singleton Set <em>{v<sub>e</sub>}</em>, we can use the union operation: <em>{v<sub>e</sub>} ∪ {v<sub>e</sub>} = {v<sub>e</sub>}</em> which gives the same result. (<em>Note: Only Sets can have unions, which combine their elements into a single Set</em>).</p>

<p>You might be wondering: "What is meant by Venus?" "Are we still talking about the planet?" "Why am I reading this?" Stick around—I'll answer these soon. For now, know that set theory lets us capture the idea of combining Venuses mathematically, <strong>distinct from arithmetic</strong>.</p>

<p>If we wanted to keep both Venuses, we could explore multisets, where <em>V = {v<sub>e</sub>, v<sub>e</sub>}</em> retains two instances.</p>

<p>In Set Theory, the curly braces {} are the "grammar" we use to denote a collection of elements, like a sentence that lists its subjects. Also, for now think of Venus as both the planet and an abstract idea we can explore mathematically, after all we are modeling things here!</p>

<p>So now let's revisit: <em>2 + 2 = 4</em> —this is strictly arithmetic. Meaning that the number represent quantities (something ordinal) instead of something abstract like the elements of a set. These ordinal values are really helpful when we want to realize something as tangible and quantifiable.</p>

<p>But even 2+2 = 4 can be converted to create a <em>Set Notation</em> where:</p>

<p><em>A = {a₁,a₂} and B = {b₁, b₂} i.e. |A| = 2 and |B| =2<br>
∴ |A∪B| = 4 & A∪B= {a₁,a₂,b₁,b₂}</em></p>

<p>The <em>|&lt;some set&gt;|</em> is just a way to note the number of elements (quantity) being held by the Set, also known as its cardinality.</p>

<p>So, that is not even scratching the surface yet and we have to make our way all the way to understanding how this all ties in with a Machine learning and extend it other realms of <em>SCIENCE!</em> I hope you're just as excited and exhausted as I am.</p>

<p>I get really anxious sometimes and feel it in my stomach which in turns takes my attention away from anything that requires it. In times as such I truly feel Human. ~~Mostly a helpless Human~~ subset of helpless Human.</p>
