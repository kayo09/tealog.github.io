# Sonder
I have so much rage in me, I could kill myself.  Doesn’t mean I do it. I hold it off. I need to update my about me info too since I do not want you to think this is a generic “white girl” excuse/ response to problems in life. I really do come to conclusion that the Doctors at Niagara general were absolutely correct when they diagnosed me w/ MDD. It really is a rRNA issue. I fucking can’t escape it. God! I wish I could kill myself..

So what is a matrix? better yet: what is a function? hell, what even is a variable? A slope? okay, can you tell me what is a cell? How about an element? Am I all over the place? Yes! Are you overwhelmed? Yes! So let’s cope with Maths, or 
as I like to call it, Maff

Let the modelling commence:

or no, wait. There is no brain intensive thought process for this tealog. I’m sorry to set you up and disappoint however I do ask you get used to it.

I am tired of being average, being among average or perhaps even being average among greats. I do stuff to code, I make stuff from time to time but honestly nothing seems to get through my insatiable heart.

But since you’re already here! let me part somethings I know that would keep you away from being depressed:

- Sleep 8 hours
- Have at least two meals. One preferably warm
- Jog/ skip or do the least to get your heart rate up. Feel you’re alive

I am sure there might be other things too that could be added to this list. But this is my base minimum. 

I have been obsessed with slipknot again. “the nameless” specifically. They seem to capture my rage without making me aggressive (instead doing the opposite). Head-banging should also be added to the aforementioned list. God. I say “god” as means of salvation. I do feel better after just cause I am conditioning myself like that, or should I say god is making me to be conditioned as such…
